Welcome to ionize's documentation!
==================================

**ionize** is Python package for modeling electrolyte chemistry.

**ionize** calculates the properties of individual ionic species in
aqueous solution, as well as aqueous solutions containing arbitrary
sets of ions.

The **ionize** model is based on techniques previously demonstrated by
Peakmaster, Spresso, and STEEP. The **ionize** model takes into account pH,
ionic strength, and temperature effects, including the  most up-to-date
temperature model published in STEEP. The **ionize** object classes make these
techniques directly accessible as a backend for simulations written in python.
